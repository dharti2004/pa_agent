      "Okay, Neha, it's great to see you're proactive about your financial future! With a solid income like yours in Ahmedabad, we can definitely work towards building a strong financial foundation. The first thing I'd recommend is tackling that car loan. Since you're paying ₹25,000 a month, let's explore if we can refinance it for a better interest rate, potentially freeing up some cash. Next, let's focus on building an emergency fund. Aim for at least 3-6 months' worth of essential living expenses – this will give you a safety net for unexpected situations. Even setting aside a small, consistent amount each month will make a difference. Once we have that emergency fund in place, we can start thinking about investments. Given your age, we have time to consider options like mutual funds or ETFs that align with your risk tolerance, which we'll need to determine. Finally, let's define your financial goals, like buying a home or planning for retirement. Knowing what you're working towards will help us create a tailored plan to get you there.\n"
